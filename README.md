# Parallel-Computing-Labs
These programs were developed as a part of the Parallel Computing 1 and 2 courses at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and technology under the guidance of Professor Shane Torbert.
As a result, parts of the programs may have been written by Dr. Torbert for the purpose of instruction. All of these programs have been written in C using OpenMP and MPI.
