# Parallel-Computing-Labs
These programs were developed as a part of the Parallel Computing 1 and 2 courses at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and technology under the guidance of Professor Shane Torbert.
As a result, parts of the programs may have been written by Dr. Torbert for the purpose of instruction. All of these programs have been written in C using OpenMP and MPI.

Programs:

Parallel Computing 1:

1) Huffman Encryption and Decryption: Decoding and Encoding conducted via an algorithm to perform both Huffman compression and decompression

2) Forest Fires: A program which takes into account tree density to generate data regarding how many trees would burn in a forest fire using parallel processing

3) Mandelbrot: Mandelbrot Animation with Zooming


Parallel Computing 2:
